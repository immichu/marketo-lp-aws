### Notes

lp-01 is the page with actual content.

The latest file to be used as template is lp-01-template.

Once in marketo, use template in a program and swap out content for tokens.

### TODO

~~Add smooth scrolling for page anchors.~~

~~Swapping of the tokens in marketo.~~

~~Adding the tracking tags to the navigation items, maybe needs to be dynamically added since the links are created in wysiwyg?... maybe.~~

When we get the Navigation example, code the collapsed version of the subnav.
